I am a Junior Full Stack Developer. I love using agile processes to create beautiful user-friendly applications that solve real problems.
<br></br>

Prior to software development, I worked as a teacher. Teaching provided inspiration to design educational products and software applications. I started to self-teach myself software development in order to actualise some of my designs. I soon realised I loved the intellectual challenge of software development, and wanted to work in this full time.

In order to learn best development practices I completed a course at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). In this course I learnt how to build full-stack applications using Test and Behaviour Driven Development, pair programming, and agile processes. I am now working to extend my leanring and helping [Denmark Street Studios](https://www.denmarkstreetstudios.com/) improve thier workflow through technical solutions.

I am looking forward to being able to contribute my skills and love of coding to a new role. I am seeking a role which will provide challenge and learning opportunities.

# Skills

### Problem solving

At Makers Academy I refined my problem-solving approach. External reviewers have provided feedback that I can break down problems very thoroughly. I use a variety of method to analyse problems, which include input and output tables, User Stories, and diagrams. When I come across something I am not sure how to code I use divergent thinking methods to come up with multiple solutions. These methods include brainstorming, experimentation and research. I will then select the best solution.

In my previous career as a teacher, I come across many educational challenges. I used design thinking processes to solve these problems by creating innovative resources. For example, I created a game to help children who were struggling with understanding the foundations of maths.

### Communication

I excel at creating an environment where everyone is on the same page and are able to actively participate. Through studying theories of education and my practical experience teaching I gained a deep understanding of the different ways people process information. I am able to make use of these different communication styles to ensure that everyone can understand and participate.
It is because of these skills I was selected to lead our final project at the start. I led the team through deciding on the features and ensured everyone listened to each other's ideas. I was able to create a shared vision by leading the creation of our team charter, which outlined our shared values and the purpose of our project.
