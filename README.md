# Gina Frankel

I am a software engineer and Makers graduate. At makers I have learnt how to build full-stack applications with Test/Behaviour Driven Development and how to use agile processes to code in collaborative team environments. I come from an education and design background. 
I was led to a Tech career by a need/desire to solve problems that people experience. I enjoy breaking down problems and applying divergent and convergent thinking strategies to solve these problems.

## Skills

### Problem solving
I approach problems through divergent and convergent thinking processes. I have a good understanding of how to utilise different thinking processes to reach solutions
At Makers Academy I have refined my problem solving approach. External reviewers have provided feedback that I am break down problems very thoroughly and ask excellent questions. I use a variety of method to analyse problems, which include User Stories, diagrams and input and output tables. I am able to employ divergent thinking. In order to solve problems I use (divergent thinking) methods such as  brainstorming, research, and experimentation. From this I will select the best solution. 

### Collaboration  
I excel at creating shared understanding and an environment where everyone is actively participating.
At Makers Academy, during groups projects I am insistent  that everyone can understand and is actively participating. I analyse how different people communicate and think, and reflect on  ways we can create an environment that everyone can participate. Working remotely, I became a advocate of using Miro and other visual tools so … visual communicators 
 I led our final project at the start and was able to create a solid foundation. I facilitated the creation of a team charter that was underpinned by shared values, created a clear vision of the purpose of our project, and ensured that everyone was able to communicate their ideas for the project. 
As a teacher I ensured that all children could participate. I would draw on various different modes of communication to ensure understanding and engagement.

## Experience
KollectiVo work experience role (June 2020 - current) 
- KollectiVo  is a finTech start up. Wrote the technical overview report in consultation with head engineer. 
 Teaching (April 2016 - January 2019)
Worked in different teaching roles across the nursery age group to year 6. I have worked in both daily supply jobs, and long term contracts.

**Daily supply** - The role required teaching and managing a class of unfamiliar children. It involved being able to quickly asses and understand the learning and behaviour support that each child needed, and to be able to respond to unanticipated situations such as a teacher not leaving a learning plan. 
 
**Long term roles** I worked in various different schools, as a nursery teacher, year 3 teacher and an intervention teacher. 
These roles involved a cycle of planning and evaluation. It involved communication with other teachers, management and parents, and the management of teaching assistants. 

## Hobbies
**Art** - Since I was a child I have been creating art in some form. I have explored many mediums including oil painting, pottery and sketching. 

**Creative Apps** - I enjoy creative visuals on Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator, and experimenting with animation through Toon Boom and Adobe After effects. 

**Design** - I love thinking about problems and designing solutions for them. For example, I am designing a series of children’s books to support mathematical concept development, and am designing  organisational solutions for people with attention processing issues

**Ping pong** - A recent discovery
