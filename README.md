I am driven by a need to solve problems and to express creativity. In my previous career as a teacher I come across many problems, such as how to create learning experiences that were meaningful and engaging but still covered the outcomes of the curriculum; and how to ensure that each experience catered for a diverse range of abilities. I used design thinking processes to solve these problems by creating innovative resources. Through this I realised that I wanted to focus on creating products to help people learn. This lead me to study software design at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) as I believe software development provides a digital canvas to actualise innovative ideas and solutions to problems.

I am thrilled that I am able to use my knowledge and skills to design and create applications that can help people. I am now looking to become part of an organisation where I can make a positive contribution as a full stack developer.

# Skills

### Problem solving

I approach problems through divergent and convergent thinking processes. I have a good understanding of how to utilise different thinking processes to reach solutions

At Makers Academy I have refined my problem solving approach. External reviewers have provided feedback that I am break down problems very thoroughly and ask excellent questions. I use a variety of method to analyse problems, which include User Stories, diagrams and input and output tables. In order to solve problems I use divergent thinking methods such as brainstorming, research, and experimentation. From this I apply analytical processes to select the best solution. I am also good at finding problems that need to be solved. For example, my groups final project at Makers was born from my realisation that it was difficult to learn VS shortcuts while simultaneously learning how to code.

In my previous career as a teacher I come across many problems, such as how to create learning experiences that were meaningful and engaging but still covered the outcomes of the curriculum; and how to ensure that each experience catered for a diverse range of abilities. I used design thinking processes to solve these problems by creating innovative resources, for example I created a game to help children who were struggling with understanding the foundations of maths.

### Creating shared understanding

I excel at creating shared understanding and an environment where everyone is actively participating.

At Makers Academy, during groups projects I am insistent that everyone can understand and is actively participating. I analyse how different people communicate and think, and reflect on ways we can create an environment that everyone can participate. I led our final project at the start and was able to create a solid foundation. I facilitated the creation of a team charter that was underpinned by shared values, created a clear vision of the purpose of our project, and ensured that everyone was able to communicate their ideas for the project.

As a teacher I ensured that all children could participate. I would draw on various different modes of communication to ensure understanding and engagement.

# Education

### Makers Academy

- Feb 2020 - June 2020
- A 16 week intensive programming bootcamp.
- The course is underpinned by Agile values and methodolgies and Test and Behaviour Driven Development. It focuses on student-led learning, by supporting students to develop solutions independently, in pairs and in groups. I have learnt how to collaborate remotely as due to COVID-19 the course was made remote.

### University

**Bachelor of Early Childhood Education (birth to 12) Macquarie University**

- March 2012 - April 2015
- Distinction

**Bachelor of Design**

- March 2009 - July 2011 (partial)
- Deans award
- Distinction

## Experience

**KollectiVo Consultant**
June 2020 - current

- Consulting with the Lead Engineer to create a technical investor ready report for the FinTech startup KollectiVo.

**Teaching**
April 2015 - January 2020
Worked in different teaching roles across the nursery age group to year 6. I have worked in both daily supply jobs, and long term contracts.

**Daily supply** - The role required teaching and managing a class of unfamiliar children. It involved being able to quickly asses and understand the learning and behaviour support that each child needed, and to be able to respond to unanticipated situations such as a teacher not leaving a learning plan.

**Long term roles** I worked in various different schools, as a nursery teacher, year 3 teacher and an intervention teacher.
These roles involved a cycle of planning and evaluation. It involved communication with other teachers, management and parents, and the management of teaching assistants.

## Interests

**Art** - Since I was a child I have been creating art in some form. I have explored many mediums including oil painting, pottery and sketching.

**Design** - I love thinking about problems and designing solutions for them. For example, I am designing a series of children’s books to support mathematical concept development, and am designing organisational solutions for people with attention processing issues

**Ping pong** - A recent discovery
