A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.

I am a software engineer and Makers grauduate. At makers I have learnt how to build full-stack applications with Behaviour Driven Development and how to use agile processes to code in colloborative team environments. I come from an education and design background, and I was led to a Tech career by a need/desire to solve problems that people experience (connect to design/ and education).  I enjoy breaking down/analysing problems and aplying divergent and convergent thinking strategies to solve these problems.

## Experience

**Teacher** (April 2016 -  January 2019)   
- Worked in  different teaching roles across the nursery age group to year 6. I have worked in both daily supply jobs, and long term contracts. 

**Daily roles**
As a daily supply teacher I would teach in different schools throughout London, greater London and Sydney Australia, and across diffrent age groups. 
The role required flexibility and adaptablity, and an ability to quickly understand what was required and respond to unanticipated situations (with creativity and calm).
It required interpersonal and management skills as involved engaging with and managing thirty unfamiliar/ new children. It also required an ability to asses children quickly and understand their needs of children (who needed additional support or those who were likely to be disruptive and maybe needed extra encouragement to stay on task).

**Long term roles**
I worked in various different schools in long term placements. These included: 
**Margaret McMillan Nursery School & Childrens Centre,  Islington** (January 2019 - July  2019)  
**Year 3 Primary teacher for Queens Park Primary** (October 2018 - December 2019)
**Intervention Teacher for St George the Matyr CofE Primary School** (January 2018 to August 2018)
**PPA cover and intervention for Underhill school** (January - April 2017)

 These roles involved a process of planning and assesemnt/evaluation. .. iterative ... and communicating with team members, managment and parents are student's progress. 
 - working with students with special needs ... adapting to different people 
- initiative - planning and running an art club 
- creativity - integrating across curriculum areas 
- understanding of development and social environment and interaction  between the two ... application of theory to practice
