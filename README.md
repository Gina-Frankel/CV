I am a Junior Full Stack Developer. I love using agile processes to create beautiful user-friendly applications that solve real problems.
<br></br>

Prior to software development, I worked as a teacher. Teaching provided inspiration to design educational products and software applications. I started to self-teach myself software development in order to actualise some of my designs. I soon realised I loved the intellectual challenge of software development, and wanted to work in this full time. 


In order to learn best development practices I completed a course at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). In this course I learnt how to build full-stack applications using Test and Behaviour Driven Development, pair programming, and agile processes. I am now working to extend my leanring and helping [Denmark Street Studios](https://www.denmarkstreetstudios.com/) improve thier workflow through technical solutions. 


I am looking forward to being able to contribute my skills and love of coding to a new role. I am seeking a role which will provide challenge and learning opportunities.

# Skills

### Problem solving

At Makers Academy I  refined my problem-solving approach. External reviewers have provided feedback that I can break down problems very thoroughly. I use a variety of method to analyse problems, which include input and output tables, User Stories, diagrams and diagrams.  When I come across something I am not sure how to code I use divergent thinking methods to come up with multiple solutions.  These methods include brainstorming, experimentation and research. I will then select the best solution.

In my previous career as a teacher, I come across many educational challenges. I used design thinking processes to solve these problems by creating innovative resources. For example, I created a game to help children who were struggling with understanding the foundations of maths.


### Creating shared understanding

I excel at creating an environment where everyone is on the same page and are able to actively participate. Through studying theories of education and my practical experience teaching  I gained a deep understanding of the different ways people process information. I am able to make use of these different communication styles to ensure that everyone can understand and participate. 
It is because of these skills  I was selected to lead our final project at the start. I led the team through deciding on the features and ensured everyone listened to each other's ideas. I  was able to create a shared vision by leading the creation of our team charter, which outlined our shared values and the purpose of our project.

# Education

### Makers Academy

- Feb 2020 - June 2020
- A 16 week intensive programming bootcamp.
- The course is underpinned by Agile values and methodolgies and Test and Behaviour Driven Development. It focuses on student-led learning, by supporting students to develop solutions independently, in pairs and in groups. I have learnt how to collaborate remotely as due to COVID-19 the course was made remote.

### University

**Bachelor of Early Childhood Education (birth to 12) Macquarie University**

- March 2011 - April 2015

## Experience

**KollectiVo Consultant** (June 2020 - current)
Consulting with the Lead Engineer to create a technical investor ready report for the FinTech startup [KollectiVo](http://kollectivo.co.uk/).

**Teaching** (April 2015 - January 2020)
Worked in different teaching roles across the nursery age group to year 6. I have worked in both daily supply jobs, and long term contracts. I also volunteered in Colombia where I taught English and ran culture and art clubs at two schools in a rural town in Colombia. 

- **Daily Supply Teaching** - 
The role required teaching and managing a class of unfamiliar children. It involved being able to quickly asses and understand the learning and behaviour support that each child needed, and to be able to respond to unanticipated situations such as a teacher not leaving a learning plan.

- **Long Term Roles** - 
  I worked in various different schools, as a nursery teacher, year 3 teacher and an intervention teacher.
  These roles involved a cycle of planning and evaluation. It involved communication with other teachers, the leadership team and parents, and the management of teaching assistants. For more information about these roles please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.ginafrankel.com/) profile.

## Interests

**Art** - Since I was a child I have been creating art in some form. I have explored many mediums including oil painting, sketching and pottert.

**Design** - I love thinking about problems and designing solutions for them. For example, I am designing a series of children’s books to support mathematical concept development, and am designing organisational solutions for people with attention processing issues

**Ping pong** - A recent discovery
