A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.

I am a software engineer and Makers grauduate. At makers I have learnt how to build full-stack applications with Behaviour Driven Development and how to use agile processes to code in colloborative team environments. I come from an education and design background, and I was led to a Tech career by a need/desire to solve problems that people experience (connect to design/ and education).  I enjoy breaking down/analysing problems and aplying divergent and convergent thinking strategies to solve these problems.
