I became a software developer as  I believe that technology provides a digital canvas to actualise innovative ideas and solutions to problems.
<br></br>

Prior to software development, I worked as a teacher in Australia, Colombia and England. While teaching I was inspired to design educational products and software applications to solve some of the current problems in education. I started to self-teach myself software development to actualise some of my designs. I soon realised I loved the intellectual challenge of software development and wanted to work in this full time.

In order to learn best development practices I completed a course at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). In this course I learnt how to build full-stack applications using TDD, pair programming, and agile processes. I am currently upskilling by building websites with React, Typescript and GraphQL. I have also been working with [Denmark Street Studios](https://www.denmarkstreetstudios.com/) to build an automation app that has greatly reduced their time spent on accounting processes.

I am looking forward to being able to use my skills to build products that can make a difference to people's lives.

# Skills

### Problem solving

I love solving problems by applying both **logical and creative processes**. I first deconstruct the problem by separating it into smaller sections. I will then analyse the key factors of the problem. If the solution is not clear I will engage in research, experimenting and brainstorming. As a teacher, I used this approach to solve educational issues. If a child was not focusing on their work I would look at all the underlying reasons, including if the work matched the child's ability and  cognitive style and if it was engaging. I would then explore less traditional teaching methods and create innovative resources to ensure that all child could excel. For example, I created a game to teach about the decimal system, which resulted in a much higher level of engagement and attainment of curriculum outcomes.

At Makers academy I learnt problem solving processes specific to programming. I am adept at using TDD and tools such as Input and Output tables, User Stories, and UML diagrams to deconstruct problems.  I love challenging coding problems which require me to brainstorm and experiment with different solutions. I have received consistent feedback from peers, coaches and external reviewers that I have a thorough and methodological approach.


### Communication

Teaching provided me with insight into how to create collaborative environments. In the classroom, I used a variety of different communication techniques to match each child’s needs. This meant that children of all different levels were able to understand and actively participate. This ability to adapt my communication to each person’s needs are very beneficial when pair programming and working in teams. At Makers Academy, whenever I led a sprint everyone’s ideas were heard, a fully unified vision for the project was developed and everyone understood what they needed to do. This always led to a far more efficient and robust implementation of the product and a more unified and focused team. 


### Learning 
I learn quickly and am intrinsically motivated. To ensure I am making progress and fully understand concepts I plan, track and assess my own learning. My understanding of educational theory ensures that I can do this effectively. I am proactive and will seek feedback from more experienced developers. I am very excited when I see a thorough code review, especially one where it focuses on small details.  Before starting at Maker's Academy I taught myself the basics of Python and Ruby. At Makers, I took every opportunity to learn and would regularly go to process reviews. Since graduating I have been working on group and independent projects. I am now much more adept at React and JavaScript and can use a variety of different React frameworks including Next and Gatsby. I have also learnt new technologies such as MongoDB, Express, Node, GraphQL, TypeScript and Sass.
