I became a software developer as a I believe that technology provides a digital canvas to actualise innovative ideas and solutions to problems.
<br></br>

Prior to software development, I worked as a teacher in Australia, Colombia and England. While teaching I was inspired to design educational products and software applications to solve some of the current problems in education. I started to self-teach myself software development in order to actualise some of my designs. I soon realised I loved the intellectual challenge of software development, and wanted to work in this full time.

In order to learn best development practices I completed a course at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). In this course I learnt how to build full-stack applications using TDD, pair programming, and agile processes. I am currently upskilling by by building websites with React, Typescript and GraphQL. I have also been working with [Denmark Street Studios](https://www.denmarkstreetstudios.com/) to build an automation app that has greatly reduced their time spent on accounting processes.

I am looking forward to being able to use my skills to build products that can make a difference to people's lifes.

# Skills

### Problem solving

I believe that any problem can be solved. My approach to solving problems involves analysing the problem, exploring different solutions and then evaluating which is the best solution. As a teacher, if a child was struggling with learning a concept I would analyse the underlying reasons for this difficulty, and then think about different ways I could present this concept to the child. This often led to creating customised resources, such as a book about a fraction eating elephant and a game to teach about the decimal system. I apply the same mix of analytical and creative problem-solving skills to software development. To breakdown coding problems I use TDD and tools such as Input and Output tables, User Stories, and UML diagrams. After analysing a problem, if the solution is still unknown, I brainstorm, research and experiment with different solutions. I love using creativity to solve real world problems and help people. For example, I created the game Mission-ctrl  to help developers overcome difficulties in learning Visual Studio shortcuts, so as to become more efficient. 

### Communication

Teaching provided me with insight into how to create collaborative environments. In the classroom, I used a variety of different communication techniques to match each child’s needs. This meant that children of all different levels were able to understand and actively participate. This ability to adapt my communication to each person’s needs are very beneficial when pair programming and working in teams. At Makers Academy, whenever I led a sprint everyone’s ideas were heard, a fully unified vision for the project was developed and everyone understood what they needed to do. This always led to a far more efficient and robust implementation of the product and a more unified and focused team. 


### Learning ability
I learn quickly and am intrinsically motivated. To ensure I am making progress and fully understand concepts I plan, track and assess my own learning. I also am proactive and will seek feedback from more experienced developers. My understanding of educational theory ensures that I can do this effectively. Before starting at Maker's Academy I learnt the basics of Python and Ruby. In the last few months I have taught myself React, Typescript and GraphQl as well as how to create responsive interfaces.
