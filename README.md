## Your Name

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.




I come  from an education and Design background, and have worked as a teacher in a range of different contexts. During my time as a teacher I observed the educational challenges faced by the students and the current tools/technologies used in schools, and I thought there must be a better way. This lead me to look at software development. I chose to come to makers to aquire the skills that would help me build products to help solve problems that we face everyday. I love the problem solving process of coding and the ability to create a tangible product just using software/code. 

I graduated from a Bachelor of Early Childhood Education (Distinction) and have worked as a teacher in a range of different contexts. Through teaching I have gained communication, team work and management skills.  I also have design skills and knowledge, and have participated in design courses and am developing design projects that aim to solve problems. My design projects include a series of childrenâ€™s books that aim to solve the problem that many children find maths unengaging; and a packing system for people with executive functioning issues.
Through design I  have gained an understanding of the design process, and the process of research and testing and skills in problem solving. A career in software development provides opportunities to create technology that can solve problems
